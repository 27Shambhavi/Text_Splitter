# RAG Text Splitter Components

A modular collection of **text splitter components for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines**.  
This repository focuses on transforming raw documents into **retrieval-optimized chunks** suitable for embeddings, vector databases, and LLM-based question answering.

## 🚀 Features

- Multiple text splitting strategies:
  - Character-based splitting
  - Token-based splitting
  - Recursive splitting
  - Semantic-aware splitting (optional / embedding-based)
- Configurable chunk size and overlap
- Metadata preservation for downstream retrieval
- Framework-agnostic design
- Easy integration with vector databases and LLM frameworks

## 📌 Why Text Splitting Matters in RAG

Effective text splitting is critical for RAG systems:
- Improves retrieval accuracy
- Preserves semantic context
- Reduces hallucinations
- Optimizes token usage for LLMs

This repo provides reusable, extensible components to experiment with and productionize chunking strategies.
